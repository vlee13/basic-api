# Basic Api

Your are going to make your own basic rest api with information of this class from a json file. It's going to have 3 endpoints:

1. GET `/students`.  Returns all the students in an array.
2. Get `/students/random`. Returns a single random student as an object.
3. Get `/students/:id`. Returns a single student with the provided id.

Make sure to test these endpoints with Postman before trying to retrieve them from the client (React). After, you should create 3 pages in react:

1. The home page. It should list all students.
2. /student/random . It should show a detail view of a random single student.
3. /student/:id. It should show the detail view of a single student.
